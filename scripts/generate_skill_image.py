"""Render a skill's workflow as a diagram, via the OpenRouter Image API.

Local repository tooling; not part of any shipped skill.

Two stages, both through OpenRouter on one OPENROUTER_API_KEY:

1. Read the whole skill -- SKILL.md, everything under references/, and a
   manifest of scripts/ and assets/ -- and have a text model distil it into a
   description of one diagram. An image model cannot digest a few hundred
   kilobytes of markdown, so something has to decide what the diagram shows
   before any pixels are requested.
2. Send that description to the image model.

The image model is fixed to openai/gpt-image-2.5-sunburst, so the parameters
accepted below are that model's advertised set rather than the API-wide
superset. It does not accept ``resolution``, ``size``, ``seed``, or
``output_format``, and OpenRouter rejects unsupported parameters with an
HTTP 400 rather than ignoring them.

Standard library only.

    "Background: a soft warm off-white, not stark white. "
    "Nodes: filled cards with generously rounded corners, a pale tinted fill and a thin "
    "border a few shades deeper in the same hue, roomy padding, and a short accent bar "
    "along the top edge in the card's role colour. "
    "Palette: role colours are deep indigo for processing stages, muted teal for inputs, "
    "warm amber for outputs, and soft warm grey for supporting detail — each a pale fill "
    "with a deeper border and matching label. "
    "Domain motifs: draw the small scientific picture named for each stage inside its "
    "card, above the label — flat, simplified to a few clean strokes, crisp at thumbnail "
    "size, never a photograph and never a fully detailed chart. Motifs may use a wider "
    "categorical palette from the same family — indigo, teal, amber, rose, sage — where "
    "the content needs several distinguishable colours, as a cluster plot does. The hero "
    "panel is drawn several times larger than the stage cards and carries the most detail. "
    "Grouping regions: very light tinted panels behind related nodes, rounded, with a "
    "small uppercase heading in letter-spaced grey. "
    "Connectors: thin lines of uniform weight in soft slate, rounded caps, small solid "
    "arrowheads, routed at clean right angles with rounded corners, never crossing a card. "
    "Every connector leaves the edge of one card and lands its arrowhead on the edge of "
    "exactly the card named as its destination; no arrow points backwards up the flow, "
    "and no arrowhead touches a card that is not its stated destination. "
    "Typography: one clean geometric sans-serif throughout — the title largest in a dark "
    "warm charcoal, node labels medium weight, secondary notes a step smaller in lighter "
    "grey. Never monospace. "
    "Layout: a strict grid with even generous gutters, deliberate contrast between the "
    "hero panel and the smaller cards, and a very faint dot grid across the background; "
    "the composition fills the whole frame with balanced margins on all four sides. "
    "Spell every label exactly as written. The quoted labels in the prompt are the "
    "COMPLETE text inventory: render each once and add NO other text anywhere. "
    "Scientific motifs must be schematic and unlabelled. Tables have empty cells; "
    "plots have no numbers, ticks, axis labels, or annotations. Never invent example "
    "identifiers, sequences, URLs, citations, code, JSON, measurements, scores, clinical "
    "classifications, dates, or biological relationships. "
    "No photorealism, no 3D, no isometric perspective, no people, no stock clip art, no "
    "generic gear or screen or cloud or lightbulb icons, no gradients, no drop shadows, "
    "no glow, no decorative background, no watermark."

DISTIL_INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You write prompts for an image model that renders technical diagrams.

Read the Agent Skill documentation below and write ONE prompt describing a single clean, \
informative diagram that shows what this skill does and the workflow it follows.

Rules:
- Open by giving the diagram a title: the skill's purpose in four words or fewer, set as \
a heading at the top left.
- Describe concrete visual structure: the nodes, how they are arranged, the arrows \
between them, and which nodes sit together inside a shared labelled region. Two or three \
such regions read better than one long undifferentiated chain.
- Give every label verbatim in double quotes. Use at most 10 labels, each at most 20 \
characters. Take them from the documentation's real vocabulary -- actual stage names, file \
formats, commands, tools -- never filler like "Input", "Process", "Output".
- The title counts toward the 10-label limit. These labels are the entire text inventory. \
Do not describe any other text, data rows, identifiers, code, URLs, dates, numbers, \
scientific measurements, classification labels, or example results for the image to fill in. \
Use unlabelled abstract scientific motifs and empty table cells instead. A workflow diagram \
must not fabricate evidence or imply that a prediction is a measured result.
- Show only a small, coherent workflow. Independent operations must not be connected as \
consecutive steps. Preserve any review or resolution gate before downstream retrieval.
- If the skill offers multiple model tasks or APIs, select ONE documented scientific \
operation. Show its input validation, that operation, and its own returned artifact with \
provenance. Never feed one prediction type into another task's output. API discovery and \
authentication are supporting detail only, never the operation that produces a result. \
Use short plain-language stage labels when a full tool name exceeds the label budget; \
never substitute a different API call or an invented abbreviated command.
- Say which nodes are inputs, which are processing stages, which are outputs, and which \
are supporting detail. Name the role, never a colour.
- Give each main stage a domain motif: a small concrete picture of what the data actually \
looks like at that point -- a scatter of clustered points, a row of violin plots, a \
heatmap grid, a sequence track, a spectrum, a circuit fragment, a molecular skeleton, a \
folded chain, a map tile, a waveform. Name each motif specifically. These carry the \
science; the labels only name it. Choose motifs this particular field would recognise.
- Vary the scale deliberately. Make one element a larger hero panel showing the \
workflow's characteristic result at a size worth looking at, with the smaller stage cards \
feeding into it. Equal-sized boxes in a row make a dull picture.
- Ground the diagram in the skill's real workflow, its inputs and its outputs. Do not \
invent a step the documentation does not describe. Motifs must depict what this skill \
genuinely produces.
- The canvas is wide. Compose for it: use the full height as well as the width by \
stacking the flow into two or three rows, or by putting labelled lanes or a tier of \
supporting detail beneath the main path. A single thin horizontal strip wastes the frame.
- Describe structure and content only. Say nothing about colours, fonts, line weights, \
textures, shading or rendering style -- those are art-directed separately, and anything \
you add will fight them.
- Reply with the prompt text only. No preamble, no markdown, no surrounding quotes.
