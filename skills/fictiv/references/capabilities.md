Material lists marked **(live)** are the retained September 2026 configurator snapshot, not a fresh authenticated audit. Official Help Center and specification pages were reviewed on 2026-09-30. They sometimes conflict: confirm the selected process/material, final quote, drawing requirements and account-specific options before ordering. An upload widget's accept list is not proof that a format can be manufactured. Re-check dropdown options with `scripts/list_dropdown_options.js`.

## 1. Processes at a glance

Advertised fastest times and recorded material counts are planning aids, not an order commitment. The configured quote determines availability, timing and cost; casting/molding sample timing does not imply completed production tooling/runs.

| Process (card name) | Quote | "As fast as" | Account needed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CNC Machining**: mill, lathe, EDM, gear hobbing, 3/5-axis | Instant; complex or drawing parts go to a human (under 2 h) | 1 day | any | 70+ materials. Tolerances to ±0.001" reliably with a drawing; marketing claims ±0.0001". Finishing, assembly, welding, inserts. |
| **3D Printing**: FDM, SLS, SLA, PolyJet, MJF, Carbon DLS | Instant | 1 day | any | 45+ materials, 11 finishes. No DMLS/metal printing listed. |
| **Urethane Casting** | Instant for simple parts, else manual | 7–10 days | company email | 12 materials. About 20 castings per silicone mold. |
| **Sheet Metal**: cutting, forming, welding, inserts | Instant | 2 days | any | 11 materials, 11 finishes |
| **Injection Molding**: production, family, multi-cavity, overmolding | Instant IM is advertised for eligible parts; other projects require review | 10 days (T1) | company email | 30+ standard / 100+ custom resins |
| **Compression Molding** | Manual (48 h) | 10 days | company email | 9 elastomers |
| **Die Casting**: high and low pressure | Manual (48 h) | 10–15 days | company email | 8 alloys, post-machining |

Fictiv doesn't design parts. It needs a 3D CAD file. Extrusion isn't a self-serve process.

## 2. File formats (live "Supported File Types" modal)

Use the [supported-format list](https://www.fictiv.com/help/uploading-and-organizing-parts/what-file-formats-does-fictiv-support). In most cases files need one solid body. The [getting-started guide](https://www.fictiv.com/help/getting-started/how-to-get-started-with-fictiv) permits modeled-in CNC pins/inserts; other separate CNC bodies must be split. The dedicated 3DP multi-body policy has functional exceptions (§4.5).

- **Parametric CAD (all processes):**
  - Dassault: `.sldprt .3dxml .catpart .catshape .cgr .dlv .exp .model .session`
  - Siemens: `.jt .par .prt .x_t .x_b`
  - STEP: `.stp .step`
  - Autodesk: `.ipt`
  - PTC: `.prt`
  - Other: `.3dm .vda .x3dv .ifc .xpr .xas .mf1 .neu .prc .sab .sat .u3d`
  - The historical uploader additionally listed `.3mf .arc .gts .ifczip .pkg .unv .xmt .xmt_txt`; public manufacturing support for these was not verified. Export STEP or a documented mesh format. `.wrl` and `.acs` are mesh formats, not CNC formats.
- **Mesh (3D printing only):** `.stl .3ds .collada .dae .obj .off .ply .v3d .pts .tri .acs .x3d .wrl`
- **PDF drawings:** must accompany a CAD file and cannot be quoted alone. The drawing guide excludes normal 3DP drawing attachment, while the quoting-time guide describes a drawing for 3DP inserts: confirm that special workflow with Fictiv before promising it.
- **Assemblies (BOM only, not quotable):** `.sldasm .asm .iam .catproduct`
- **Not supported:** IGES, `.f3d`, `.slddrw`, `.dxf`, `.catdrawing`, native Solid Edge `.psm` and `.pwd` (export STEP).
- **SolidWorks:** save a single configuration, because multi-config files are rejected.
- **File size limit:** not documented.

**Best choice:** STEP (AP214 or AP242), one part per file, modeled at true size.

## 3. CNC machining

### 3.1 Materials (live list)

- **Aluminum:** 2024 (T3/T351/T4), 5052 (H32), 6061 (T6/T651/T6511), 6063 (T5/T52), 7050 (T7451), 7075 (T6/T651/T6511/T7351), MIC-6
- **Stainless steel:** 15-5 PH, 17-4 PH (Annealed / H1150 / H900), 303, 304/304L, 316/316L, 410, 416, 420, 440C, A286, Nitronic 60
- **Steel:** 1045, 1215, 12L14, 4130, 4140, 4340, 8620, A2 tool, A36, A514, Cast Iron, D2 tool, Inconel 625, Inconel 718, O1 tool, 1018, Zinc-Galvanized Low-Carbon Steel, Galvannealed Steel
- **Copper, brass, bronze:** 101 Cu, 110 Cu, 260 Brass, 360 Brass, 544 / 932 / 954 Bearing Bronze
- **Plastic:** ABS, Acrylic, Chemical-Resistant PVC, Delrin (20% GF), Delrin 150, Delrin AF (13% PTFE), Garolite G-10, HDPE, Nylon (30% GF), Nylon 6/6, PEEK, PEEK (30% GF), Polycarbonate, Polypropylene, PPS, PTFE (Teflon), Torlon PAI 4301, UHMW, ULTEM 1000
- **Titanium:** Grade 2, Grade 5
- **Exotic:** AZ31B / AZ61B / AZ91D Magnesium, Invar 36, Kovar, Zamak 3
- **Custom Materials, Other:** these force a manual quote

Machinability affects price. Aluminum and brass are fastest and cheapest. Stainless, titanium, Inconel and tool steels cost more and take longer.

### 3.2 Finishes

Live menu for 6061:
- Anodize per MIL-PRF-8625 **Type II**
- **Type III** (hardcoat)
- **Type III w/ PTFE**
- **Chem Film (Alodine™)**
- **ENP** (electroless nickel)
- **Media Blasting** (Fictiv's name for bead blast)
- **Nickel Plating**
- **Powder Coating**
- **Vibratory Tumble**

Type II colors (live): Natural, Black, Blue, Gold, Red, all sealed. Type II added 2 days in the prior quote snapshot; the current [finish specification guide](https://www.fictiv.com/specifications/surface-finishes) lists a general 5–10 day range. Use the actual quote delta, not a fixed promise.

Other finishes by material (Help Center):
- **Steel and stainless:** Black Oxide, Passivation, Electropolish, Zinc Plating, ENP, Powder coat, Media blast, Tumble
- **Acrylic:** Hand polish
- **Polycarbonate:** Vapor polish

The recorded configurator default was **As machined: ISO Grade N7, Ra 1.6 µm / 63 µin**. The current [CNC specifications](https://www.fictiv.com/specifications/cnc-machining) also describe Ra 3.2 µm as a standard finish. Verify the actual quoted requirement rather than assuming either applies universally.
- Custom Ra, cosmetic specs, masking, Type I anodize and custom colors all need a drawing and/or manual review.
- Powder coat supports Pantone and RAL matching (ask).

### 3.3 Tolerances and surface

- **Default without a drawing:** ISO 2768-medium. Standard inspection is by hand metrology.
- **Tighter:** call it out on a PDF drawing.
  - The Help Center's reliable ceiling is **±0.025 mm (±0.001")**.
  - Marketing claims down to ±0.0001" for metals.
  - Plastics: Fictiv flags anything under ±0.1 mm and can't hold under ±0.05 mm. Use PEEK for stability.
- **Roughness:**
  - 6.3–12.5 µm: coarse
  - 1.6–3.2: standard
  - 0.4–0.8: fine
  - 0.1–0.2: fine polish
  - 0.025–0.05: super-fine
  - The best "machined" finish is Ra 0.4.

### 3.4 Threads

- The Threads tab offers standard UNC/UNF, metric coarse and fine, ACME, trapezoidal and BSP threads that fit each modeled hole, each with a max tap depth.
- **Model tapped holes at tap-drill size.**
- Keep tap depth ≤ 3× diameter. 1–1.5× diameter of engagement is enough.
- Non-standard threads are "produced at risk" and need a drawing.
- Inserts, helicoils, dowel pins and hardware go through a drawing plus "Contact us".

### 3.5 Size limits

- **Help Center:** mill 1828 × 500 × 152 mm (72 × 20 × 6 in); lathe Ø152 × 394 mm. The Help Center pairs this with 6 × 12 in, an inconsistent conversion (394 mm is about 15.5 in); confirm the actual turning envelope with Fictiv.
- **Marketing:** up to 48 in length. A large-parts program reaches up to 10.5 m × 3.7 m × 1.2 m through sales.
- Oversize parts go to manual review or sales.

### 3.6 Design rules (DFM)

These are what trigger Fictiv's warnings:
- **Walls:** at least 0.5 mm metal and 1.0 mm plastic is safe. Fictiv's DFM flagged "below our minimum thickness (0.5mm for metals)" live. The glossary's hard floor is 0.25 mm metal / 0.5 mm plastic.
- **Internal vertical corners** are always radiused ("Fillets: Added"). Model radii at or above 0.8 mm, and slightly larger than a standard tool (e.g. R3.2 instead of R3.175). Sharp internal corners otherwise mean EDM, which costs more and takes longer.
- **Pocket depth:** keep it to 5× tool diameter or less; up to 10× is possible. Rough limits by material: plastics 15×, aluminum 10×, steel 5×.
- **Drill depth:** keep it to 6× diameter or less; up to 12× is possible. Make blind holes 25% deeper than the thread.
- **Turning:** L:D of 8:1 or less.
- **Text:** at least 0.020" deep and 0.030" wide.
- **Setups:** aim for 1–2. Parallel, flat outer faces are easiest to hold.
- **Undercuts, unreachable volumes and gear hobbing** mean manual review, EDM or overseas-only production.

## 4. 3D printing

### 4.1 Technologies and materials (live list)

- **SLS:** Nylon 12, Nylon 12 Fire Retardant, Nylon 12 Glass-Filled, TPU 88A
- **MJF:** PA 12, PA 12 Glass Beads
- **SLA:** Accura 25, Accura 60, Accura AMX Rigid Black, Accura ClearVue, Accura Xtreme Gray, Accura Xtreme White 200, Somos Evolve, Somos PerFORM, Somos WaterClear, Somos WaterShed
- **FDM:** ABS, ABS ESD, ABS M30i, ASA, Nylon 6 CF, PC + ABS, PC-ISO, PETG, Polycarbonate, Ultem 1010, Ultem 9085
- **PolyJet:** ABS-like, Rubber-Like, VeroBlack, VeroClear, VeroWhite
- **Carbon DLS:** EPU 40/41, EPX 82, EPX 86FR, FPU 50, Loctite 3D 3843, IND147, IND405 Clear, MPU 100, RPU 70, UMA 90
- **Custom Materials, Other**

### 4.2 Which technology to use (Fictiv's guidance)

- **FDM:** cheapest early prototypes. Visible layers. Infill 10–25% by default and adjustable.
- **SLA:** high detail and smooth surfaces. Clear parts with ClearVue or WaterClear.
- **SLS / MJF:** functional nylon parts, low-to-mid volume, no supports. MJF is grey by default and can be dyed black.
- **PolyJet:** visual models, rubber-like overmold mock-ups. Avoid internal cavities.
- **Carbon DLS:** production-grade elastomers and rigid parts. Repeatable.

### 4.3 Tolerances

The current [3DP specification table](https://www.fictiv.com/specifications/3d-printing) gives typical values of FDM ±0.5 mm, SLA ±0.15 mm, SLS/MJF ±0.3 mm, and PolyJet/Carbon DLS ±0.1 mm. These are guidance, not a guarantee for a chosen part. The [older Help Center tolerance article](https://www.fictiv.com/help/fictiv-teams/what-are-your-standard-manufacturing-tolerances) still gives different PolyJet/SLA values and wider tolerances for large parts. Confirm critical dimensions and material-specific capability with Fictiv; consider CNC for critical fits.

### 4.4 Max build size (mm)

- FDM ABS: 406×355×406 (Help Center); large-format FDM up to 914×609×914
- MJF: 380×284×380
- SLS: 700×380×580
- PolyJet: 490×390×200
- SLA: 254³ for Accura 25 (Help Center); up to 635×736×533 (capability page)
- Carbon: 189×118×326

### 4.5 Design rules

- **Minimum walls:** FDM >1 mm, PolyJet >1 mm (rubber-like 2 mm). Spec page: SLA 0.4, SLS 0.7, MJF 0.5 mm.
- Avoid trapped internal cavities in SLS (powder) and PolyJet (support).
- Heat-set threaded inserts are available and go to engineering review in under 2 h.
- DFM for 3DP is limited to wall-thickness checks.
- The [dedicated multi-body policy](https://www.fictiv.com/help/getting-a-quote/multiple-body-files-in-3d-printing) accepts functional interlinked bodies and conditionally processed assembly-to-STL exports, with collision/slicing risks. Separate floating bodies or duplicated parts in one file are unacceptable; upload unique parts separately and set quantity in the quote. The checker cannot classify these exceptions or establish printability.

## 5. Sheet metal

- **Volume:** 10–200 units typical. Max 2200×1200×1000 mm. Mesh files are not accepted.

## 7. Injection molding

Sources: [current service capabilities](https://www.fictiv.com/capabilities/injection-molding-services) and [design specifications](https://www.fictiv.com/specifications/injection-molding).

- **Tooling:**
  - GlobalFlex (inserts in shared frames, CN, US or MX)
  - Traditional aluminum or steel (US)
  - Mantle printed-steel inserts (US)
  - Production Import
  - China steel
  - Class 101 or 103; multi-cavity and family molds
- **Lead times:** T1 samples as fast as 10 days, typically 2–5 weeks. Production runs 4–7 business days after T1 approval.
- **Resins:** ABS, POM, ASA, HDPE, LDPE, HIPS, PA66 (±GF), PBT, PC (±GF), PC/ABS, PEEK, PEI, PET, PMMA, PP, PPA, PPO, PPS, PPSU, PVC, SAN, TPE, TPU, TPV, EPDM, silicone (LSR). Custom resins are available.
- **Surface and extras:** SPI A-1 to D-3, Mold-Tech and Yick Sang textures; overmolding, insert molding, 2K/3K, gas-assist; pad printing, plating, laser marking, ultrasonic welding, heat staking; PPAP, FAI, Cpk.
- **Design:**
  - Nominal wall 2–3 mm, uniform within ±10%.
  - Draft 0.5–2°.
  - Ribs 50–65% of the wall.
  - Standard tolerance ±0.030".
- **DFM report:**
  - Slides are marked Warning, Approval required or Revision required.
  - Annotate slides, then "Notify Fictiv".
  - Confirm tooling ownership/storage in the agreement. The current service page describes two years after the last order, then shipping/destruction at the customer's direction; a universal $500/year fee was not verified.
- **Tooling payment:** read the actual tooling quote and approved credit terms; a universal upfront or 50/50 schedule was not verified in the current public workflow.

## 8. Compression molding and die casting

- **Compression molding:** silicone, SBR, natural rubber, neoprene, NBR, FKM/Viton, HNBR, PU, EPDM. Max 1000×600 mm. SPI and Mold-Tech finishes, pad print, color match.

  - Finishes: powder coat (black or white), others.
- Both are manually quoted. Allow 24–48 h.

## 9. Inspection and certificates

| Option | Where | Cost / time | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard Inspection Report | Included automatically | free | — |
| Advanced Inspection Report (CMM, laser, optical) | Config → Inspections → Add | per part; +3–5 business days | Bubbled drawing |
| Certificate of Conformity | Config → Certificates → Add | $100 in the reviewed Help Center; verify quote | Drawing callout required |
| Material Certification | Config → Certificates → Add | varies; availability not guaranteed | Drawing callout and request before ordering |
| FAI, custom reports, PPAP | "Contact us" / chat / account manager | quoted | Drawing; discuss with AE *before* ordering |

The [inspection/certificate protocol](https://www.fictiv.com/help/fictiv-teams/2372639-inspection-reports-and-certificates-of-conformance) requires drawing callouts and a discussion with the account executive before ordering. Drawing callouts alone may leave costs and added days absent from an RFQ. Check that the returned quote actually includes every requested deliverable.

## 10. Lead-time mechanics

- Production days are **business days**. Orders placed after the daily cutoff start the next business day.
  - The live checkout banner showed an **8 PM** cutoff. The Help Center says 3 pm PT. Trust the banner.
- The quote's ship date is driven by the **slowest part**. Finishes, inspections and EDM add days.
- **Six tiers per quote:** North America (USA or Mexico) Fastest / Standard / Cost-effective, and Overseas Fastest / Standard / Cost-effective. "USA only" restricts production to US suppliers.
- **Holidays:** use the quote ship date and checkout holiday schedule. The public [production-holidays article](https://www.fictiv.com/help/getting-started/what-are-fictivs-production-holidays) still lists 2024–2025 dates as of review; do not reuse that calendar for 2026 or infer a current closure duration.
- Quotes normally expire after **30 days**, unless the quote explicitly states otherwise.

## 11. Compliance

- **Export control:** EAR99 and 9E991 are self-serve. Other ECCNs go through Fictiv's off-platform request form.
- **ITAR:** not supported. Files and quotes with ITAR language are auto-deleted. Uploading controlled data violates the Terms.
- **If a user's part is defense, space or aerospace hardware, ask about its classification before uploading.**
- **IP:** Fictiv strips identifying info before sharing with partners. Partners are under NDA. The [Terms](https://www.fictiv.com/terms) restrict generative-AI training but include an exception for irreversibly de-identified, aggregated data that cannot identify the customer or reconstruct their information; do not promise an unconditional ban. A mutual NDA is available through the contact form (1–2 business days).
- **End-use declaration:** Prototype or Commercial; the international-shipping guide explicitly requires this for non-tooling quotes, including reorders. Read the current declaration for tooling-specific flows.

## 12. Tools and integrations

- **Materials.AI:** an in-app ("Ask Materials.AI") and web (fictiv.com/ai/materials) chat for choosing materials. Informational only; needs a company email.
- **Atlas** ([atlas.fictiv.com](https://atlas.fictiv.com)): a separate CNC analysis app. The reviewed public page exposes Upload part, My parts and Login, with feedback on setups, machine time and tooling; it is not a waitlist-only page. Its upload banner and Terms are separate: do not assume the main platform's export exceptions automatically apply.
- **Punchout:** cXML to SAP Ariba, Coupa and Dynamics 365 (Teams only).
- **No public customer API contract was found in the reviewed official documentation.** Use the browser workflow or a Fictiv-provisioned Punchout integration. The historical app snapshot referenced `prod-graphql.fictiv.com`, but no supported endpoint paths, authentication, GraphQL schema, request/response contract, version or pagination semantics were verified. Do not call that private service or invent an SDK. Absence of public documentation does not establish that no private integrations or CAD plugins exist.
